# Exploration with CAS-I1UC126B PR(Lab)

**What is SCILAB?** It is a software for **Numerical computations 2D/3D Plotting**. It is enhance the **numerical computational skills** of prospective engineers using open  source software/ computer algebra system(CAS). Many numerical problems can be expressed in a reduced number of code lines, as compared to similar solutions using traditional languages.

* Free and open source software.
* CNES (French Space Satellite Agency) using Scilab successfully.
* IIT Mumbai: Shifting all computational labs to Scilab
* Console is the main window of Scilab
*Used for executing commands(Instructions)
*Opening other windows
*Running programs written by the user

* **The ‘prompt’  :        -->** The horizontal inbuilt arrow on console is called prompt in front of which we write instruction(s) called command line.
* Role of ‘enter key’:  We get the output of our calculations done on console by pressing the enter key. It is also used to write new command line 
* ‘ans=’ as the default variable:
