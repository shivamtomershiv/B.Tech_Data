# Exploration with CAS-I1UC126B PR (Lab)

**What is SCILAB?** It is a software for **Numerical computations 2D/3D Plotting**. It is enhance the **numerical computational skills** of prospective engineers using open  source software/ computer algebra system(CAS). Many numerical problems can be expressed in a reduced number of code lines, as compared to similar solutions using traditional languages.

* Free and open source software.
* CNES (French Space Satellite Agency) using Scilab successfully.
* IIT Mumbai: Shifting all computational labs to Scilab
* Console is the main window of Scilab
*Used for executing commands(Instructions)
*Opening other windows
*Running programs written by the user

* **The ‘prompt’  :        -->** The horizontal inbuilt arrow on console is called prompt in front of which we write instruction(s) called command line.
* Role of ‘enter key’:  We get the output of our calculations done on console by pressing the enter key. It is also used to write new command line 
* ‘ans=’ as the default variable:

**Role of commas ( , )** We can write Multiple commands on same command line separated by commas ,. **eg**(--> 2,3,5)

**Role of semicolon ( ; )** If a semicolon(;) is typed at the end of a command the output of the command is not displayed. **eg**(--> 2;3;5)

**Role of commands:  clc  and  clear**

**clc** is used to clear the console  though data will still remain stored in the memory
**clear** removes data from memory

###   Arithmetic Operations with scalars

| Operation | SciLab Symbol | Example |
| :---            |  :---:  |        :---: |
| Addition        | +       |   -->3+4     |               
| Substraction    | -       |   -->4-2     |
| Multiplication  | *       |   -->3*4     |
| Division        | /       |   -->3/4     |
| Exponential     | ^       |   -->3^4     |

###   Order or precedence
|  Precedence  | Mathematical Operation |
| :---         |     :---:              |
| First        | Parenthesis            |
| Second       | Exponential            |
| Third        | Multiplications, Division (Equal Precedence) |
| Fourth       | Addision, Substraction (Equal Precedence)    |
